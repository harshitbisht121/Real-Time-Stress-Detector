# Real-Time-Stress-Detector
A deep-learning powered facial emotion and stress detection system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze facial expressions and classify emotional states in real-time. The project includes a training pipeline, a saved model (model.h5), and a live webcam-based detection interface built using OpenCV and Eel for a lightweight UI.
